Competition or Chaos? Donor Fragmentation and the Politics of Aid Effectiveness

Donor fragmentation—where multiple donors provide aid to the same region without coordination—has been criticized for creating inefficiencies and overburdening recipient governments (Knack & Rahman, 2007; Easterly, 2007). While this fragmentation often hinders cohesive development strategies resulting in less effective aid outcomes, some research suggests that competition between donors can drive innovation and offer recipient governments more choice (Dreher & Fuchs, 2015). Despite these insights, little is known about how these dynamics play out at the sub-national level, where political and institutional contexts often vary significantly across regions within the same country. This research project aims to investigate how donor fragmentation influences aid effectiveness at the sub-national level, identifying the political and institutional factors that determine whether fragmentation leads to improved or diminished development outcomes. National policies and institutional quality have long been recognized as crucial determinants of aid effectiveness (Burnside & Dollar, 2000; Acemoglu, Johnson & Robinson, 2001). At the national level, well-functioning governments may be better equipped to leverage competition for better deals and manage multiple donors, while weak governments might struggle to do so. However, at the sub-national level, the impact of fragmentation on aid effectiveness is likely to be shapednot only by these national factors, but alsobya combination of local political factors, governance capacity,and institutional frameworks. Sub-national governments with greater administrative capacity are better positioned to coordinate donor efforts and align aid with local priorities, while weaker regions may face inefficiencies and duplication (Faguet, 2014). Furthermore, decentralized political systems, where local leaders exert greater influence over donor activities, may foster better alignment of fragmented aid with local needs. In centralized systems, fragmented aid flows mayreflect national priorities, potentially sidelining regional needs (Ahmad et al., 2005). This misalignment can exacerbate inefficiencies, as local needs are sidelined, and regional governments may struggle to manage donor competition effectively.
